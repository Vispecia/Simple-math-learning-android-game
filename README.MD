### What i use?

I used android studio to make this application.

UI elements : GridView, Buttons, TextView, Spinner, ImageView
Programming language: Java, xml

### Your task

I intentionally didn't add ```division``` operation. I want you to add this if you're cloning this repository, just for fun and only if you just started android development :). If you're doing this then beware for ```divide by zero error```
